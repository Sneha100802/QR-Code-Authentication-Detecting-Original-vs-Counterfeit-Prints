# QR Code Authentication: Detecting Original vs Counterfeit Prints

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can distinguish between **original QR codes (first prints)** and **counterfeit copies (second prints)**. Counterfeit detection is crucial in various industries like finance, pharmaceuticals, and ticketing systems.  

We use two approaches:  
âœ” **Traditional Machine Learning (SVM)** â€“ Uses handcrafted features for classification.  
âœ” **Deep Learning (CNN)** â€“ Uses convolutional layers to automatically extract patterns.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description  
The dataset consists of QR code images with embedded copy detection patterns:  
- **First prints** â€“ Original QR codes with embedded security features.  
- **Second prints** â€“ Counterfeits created by scanning and reprinting first prints.
